   - Upon appointment confirmation:
     - The ClickUp task is updated to include the word `Booked` in a designated field.
     - The selected meeting date is added to a ClickUp task field.

3. **Integration Technologies**:  
   - **Google Calendar API** for appointment management.  
   - **ClickUp API** for task field updates.
